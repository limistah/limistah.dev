Byte masking is a process of flipping the smallest unit of computing value called bits.\nSome CS Background Computer as you interact with it is basically 1s and 0s on the lowest level. This text you are reading is represented as a bunch of 1s and 0s inside the computer. These values represent the state of a very tiny piece of a device called a transistor.\nTransistors as electronic devices are very unique and useful, they behave like light bulbs (i.e. they can be turned on and off), what makes them very useful to us today is that they can maintain their state(either on or off) over a very long time. Each of these states is represented as either on(0) or off (1).\nBits to Bytes After the advancement of transistors, the next phase is on how to make them useful for everyday usage(what technology is meant for), which is how to make transistors as a storage devices. But we can’t store the Alphabet as on and off or 1 and 0, the byte was invented.\nA byte is a representation of a group of bits. Eight(8) bits would produce One(1) byte. Storing this on transistors means that transistors have to be grouped, and each group would have an identity. For example, if we have 32 transistors, that is 32 bits, and can be further converted to 32 / 8 = 4bytes, another example is if we have 32000 bits we would have 4000bytes. The 4000bytes can be simplified by dividing by 1000 to create a kilo version, hence 4000byes/1000=4Kbytes\nBytes to ASCII code With computers stuck at 1s and 0s, it makes more sense to stick to just the base 2 numbering system for computer arithmetic operations. For example, 1 + 1 in base 2 equals 0 (add both numbers, divide by 2 then take note of the remainder after the division), and 1+0 in base 2 equals 1 (subtract both numbers, then divide by 2, then take note of the remainder after the division).\nWith these genius concepts, invention went further by assigning numbers to every number, character, and symbol ever known to man. This assignment is called ASCII character code. A(capital alphabet) is a different character from a(smaller alphabet) and both have unique ASCII numbers. For A the ASCII code is 065 and ais 097.\nRepresenting characters Representing a character on a transistor(in bits) becomes easier, convert the code from base 10 to 2. For A the base 10 value is 065, while the base 2 value is 01000001 and for the small a with a base 10 value of 097 the base 2 value is 01100001. Numbers written in base 10 are called Decimal Numbers, while numbers written in base 2 are called Binary numbers.\nRepresenting words Since we can store numbers, characters, and symbols, we should be able to store words. Words are a group of letters and somehow letters, and alphabets, it is safe to use string, so a string of numbers, alphabets, and symbols.\nThis can be easily done by taking a consecutive byte(recall that this means 8 units of bits) until all the characters in the string are represented. For example, to represent hello we would take the first byte and fill it with 01101000 (104 in ASCII) for h, then 01100101 (101 in ASCII) for e, then 01101100 (108 in ASCII) for l, then 01001100 (076 in ASCII) for l, and 01101111 (111) for o.\nGrouping this together it forms a string of 0s and 1s like this\n0110100001100101011011000110110001101111.\nWhat is byte masking? Byte masking is data manipulation at the bit level. What is happening is based on the kind of byte masking operation, we are instructing the transistor to switch to another state or maintain their state. For example, the binary code for the number 1 is 1, and for 2 is 10, and a bitwise OR operator on both numbers would give 3.\nconst foo = 1 // 01 in binary const bar = 2 // 10 in binary foo | bar // =\u003e 3 , 11 in binary What is happening here is in the way the bitwise OR operator works. It adds up the binary numbers, divides the result by 2, and records the remainder. Here if we do a right-to-left addition, 1+0 would give 1 divided by 2 gives zero but left with 1, and to the right we have the same operation we would end up with 1 as well. But, 11 is a binary representation of 3 in decimal numbers.\n0 1 | 1 0 ------ 1 1 # Taking the top right and the bottom right 1 + 0 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the remainder as the answer # Taking the top left and the bottom left 0 + 1 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the remainder as the answer #------ 11 in base 2 is 3 in base 10 1 | 2 returns 3 Be aware that 1 is not stored as 1 in computers but as 00000001 same for 2, it is rather stored as 00000010 for consistency against larger values.\nMasking Operators To better understand byte masking operations, take a look at what each masking operator would do for you.\nThe Bitwise OR operator As shown earlier, this operator returns the result of adding two bytes together. In the case of 1 and 2, we added 00000001 and 00000010 together to result into this 00000011.\nIf the addition seems more arithmetic here is a better way to understand this:\n// OR Operator 00000001 00000010 = 00000011 As long as there is 1 in any of the values we are comparing, the result must return 1.\nThe Bitwise AND Operator This is the reverse of the bitwise OR operator. Instead of taking the remainder, we take the result of the division by 2.\n# 01 \u0026 10 0 1 \u0026 1 0 ------- 0 0 # Taking the top right and the bottom right 1 + 0 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the result of the division as the answer # Taking the top left and the bottom left 0 + 1 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the result of the division as the answer ----- 00 in base 2 is 0 in base 10 1 \u0026 2 returns 0 A better way to understand this without the math\n# AND Operator +-------------------------------+ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ \u0026 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | +-------------------------------+ = | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | +-------------------------------+ As long as there is a 0 in any of the columns we are comparing, the result must return 0.\nThe Bitwise XOR Operator For the XOR operator, it checks if the remainder after the division of the two values is equal to 0, if it is, then the result is the same as the division (0, mostly for 0 + 1, 1 + 0 operations) , if the remainder after the division is 1 then the result is the remainder (0, mostly for 1 + 1 operations).\n# XOR Operator 101 | 110 1 0 1 | 1 1 0 ------- 0 1 1 Taking the top right and the bottom right 1 + 0 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the remainder as the answer since the result is 0 Taking the top middle and the bottom middle 0 + 1 = 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1, take the remainder as the answer since the result is 0 Taking the top left and the bottom left 1 + 1 = 2 2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0, take the result of the division as the answer since the remainder is 0 ----- 11 in base 2 is 3 in base 10 1 | 2 returns 3 Without the arithmetic:\n# 10000101 ^ 00000110 +-------------------------------+ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ^ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | +-------------------------------+ = | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | +-------------------------------+ The Bitwise NOT operator This operator basically negates the value of each bit. If a bit is 0 it becomes 1 and if it is 1 it basically becomes 0. For example:\n# NOT Operator ~ 101 ----- = 010 Also,\n# NOT Operator ~ 010 ----- = 101 Other operators There are still two more operators, the Left Shift Operator and the Right Shift Operator. Both try to inverse(change to the other value)\nVoila!\n","wordCount":"1620","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-09-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-09-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"AI"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://limistah.dev/posts/byte-operators/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"limistah","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://limistah.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body

For example, the binary code for the number 1 is 1, and for 2 is 10, and a bitwise OR operator on both numbers would give 3.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kr>const</span> <span class=nx>foo</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=mi>1</span> <span class=c1>// 01 in binary

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>What is happening here is in the way the bitwise OR operator works. It adds up the binary numbers, divides the result by 2, and records the remainder. Here if we do a right-to-left addition, 1+0 would give 1 divided by 2 gives zero but left with 1, and to the right we have the same operation we would end up with 1 as well. But, 11 is a binary representation of 3 in decimal numbers.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>   <span class=m>0</span> <span class=m>1</span>
