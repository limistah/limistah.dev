### Projects

Got the design for [WitOps](https://witops.cloud), I don't feel great about it, so we are going through a second phase of the redesign.

Got the design for [ObjectSpread](https://objectspread.com), and I would be hosting a newsletter on Substack, seems like a wise choice as it handles subscriptions automatically.

Since my website is more usable, I think it can serve me for the next 5yrs(yaaay...). Next focus is on redesigning ObjectSpread and WitOps.

I still think hard on the project-per-quarter thingy, it still interests me to do! I might start with very useful libraries in the second quarter of 2026.


I have a private foundation that I passively operated, just in my mind, I was thinking of formalizing it, we shall see if this is still possible.
### Volunteering

- I help organize GopherCon - The largest Go event in Africa.

- Part of the CNCF community - I focus on Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Jaeger.
