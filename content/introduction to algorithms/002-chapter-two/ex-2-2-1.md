## ‚ùì Question
<blockquote>

Express the function $n^3/100 + 100n^2 - 100n + 3$ in terms of $\Theta$- notation.

</blockquote>

## üí° Answer

<blockquote>

We can express it as $n^3 * 1/100 + 100 * n^2 + 100 * n + 3$

Making 1/100 as a, and the first 100 as b and the last 100 as c

$a * n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + 3$

$an^3 + bn^2 + cn + 3$

Ignoring the coefficients

$n^3 + n^2 + n$

The running time is a quadratic function of n.

$ \Theta(n^3) + \Theta(n^2) +\Theta(n)$

Such that $n^3$ > $n^2$ > $n$.

The most significant part of the running time is  $\Theta(n^3)$ as we can eliminate the less significant part.

So,

$n^3 * 1/100 + 100 * n^2 + 100 * n + 3$ = $\Theta(n^3)$
