## ‚ùì Question
<blockquote>

The test in line 1 of the $MERGE-SORT$ procedure reads ‚Äúif $p ‚â• r$‚Äù rather than ‚Äúif $p ‚â† r$.‚Äú If MERGE_SROT is called with $p > r$, then the subarray $A[p:r]$ is empty.

Argue that as long as the initial call of $MERGE-SORT(A, 1, n)$ has $n ‚â• 1$, the test ‚Äúif $p ‚â† r$‚Äù suffices to ensure that no recursive call has $p > r$.

## üí° Answer

<blockquote>

üí° We can prove this using induction:

**Base Case:**
The initial call is $MERGE-SORT(A, 1, n)$ 
where $n > 1$, $p = 1$, $r = n$   $\therefore$    $p ‚â§ r$

**Recursive step:**
Assuming a recursive call is made with p ‚â§ r. Then:
- Compute $q = \lfloor(p+r)/2\rfloor$

The two recursive calls:

1. $MERGE-SORT(A, p, q)$
- Since $q = \lfloor(p+r)/2\rfloor$, then $p ‚â§ q ‚â§ r$
- So, $p ‚â§ q$ ( and not $p > q$)

2. $MERGE-SORT(A, q+1, r)$
- $q + 1 ‚â§ r$ only if $q < r$
- Since $q = \lfloor(p+r)/2\rfloor$, then $q ‚â§ r - 1$ $\equiv$ $q + 1 ‚â§ r$

Therefore in all of the recursive calls

$q + 1 ‚â§ r$  $\equiv$  $p ‚â§ r$

So, $p > r$ can never happen if $MERGE-SORT$ is only called when $p ‚â† r$
