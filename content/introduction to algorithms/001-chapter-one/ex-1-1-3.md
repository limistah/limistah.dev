## ❓ Question 

> Select a data structure that you have seen and discuss its strengths and weaknesses.

## 💡 Answer

> Data Structure: List

> Strength: It has a moderate lookup, insertion to the end is also fast same with deleting the last element.

> Weakness: It is very slow to delete an item in the middle or the first item, it is also very slow at inserting an item at the start. Deleting an item at the start and middle is slow as the list has to readjust its indexes while deleting the last item is fast considering the index stays the same only the length has to be readjusted.
