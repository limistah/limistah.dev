## ❓ Question 

> How are the shortest path above and the traveling salesperson problems given above similar?
> 
> How are they different?

## 💡 Answer

> Both problems are graph problems and seek the optimal path to fulfill certain criteria.
> 
> The difference is that while a Traveling Sales Person is seeking to tour all the nodes, the shortest path is seeking to tour a few nodes optimally.
> 
> In the shortest path, when represented as a graph the objective is to find the smallest weight along a path between the two nodes. 
> 
> In traveling salesperson the object is to minimize the total distance traveled in a tour, visiting each node exactly once
