**We’re Not Solving a Criminal Case 😉**

Back in 2021, while working at eConnectNP as a Software Engineer, I had the chance to work alongside a very good friend of mine, Cyril. We had many interesting conversations, mostly because we shared similar views on many things. One topic that stood out was how people with incredible talents often fail to live up to expectations—how they don’t end up living the victorious life you’d expect.

The first time we spoke about it, I said the problem was that they didn’t take their skills seriously enough to make a career out of them. The second time, I added that even when they did, they didn’t treat it as a business.

In my last post, I emphasized the importance of choosing what to work on. But here’s the thing: that’s not enough. I ended that post by talking about how first-class students often don’t translate their academic success into real-world success. This post is here to show you why simply having a bank of skills doesn't guarantee you'll get rewarded for them—and how people with average abilities sometimes do better in life than those with the most talent.

Let me walk you through this thought process.

> Why do you think we all tune in to watch the FIFA World Cup?

A quick answer: You enjoy sports.

> But have you thought about how it's even possible for you to watch a live match happening thousands of miles away?

You might say satellite TV or live internet streaming.

> Sure. But let’s go a bit further. What exactly makes it possible for you to sit comfortably at home and watch the game live?

Well, you probably pay for a subscription or buy data to stream it.

> Exactly. But why do you have to pay?

Because you’re being charged for using the service.

> True. But it’s also a charge for someone’s expertise.

You might hear people say footballers earn too much, and I’d agree. But the better question is: are we paying them to do what they’re incredibly good at?

Think about musical artists. As a Nigerian, my favorites are Wizkid and Olamide—and with money in mind, I’d also add Don Jazzy to that list. No one argues their talent. Whether they trained for it or it’s natural, they’ve reached a level of mastery few can touch. And they’ve been rewarded accordingly.

But here’s the trillion-dollar question: how many equally talented and hardworking artists exist without even a fraction of their success? And we can go the other way: how many average artists exist and thrive more than talented ones?

If you dig deep enough, I often say you’ll probably find someone who plays football better than Messi and Ronaldo combined. Or a genius who could teach Einstein a thing or two about Physics. Or a golfer more skilled than [Tiger Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods). The real issue is where these people apply themselves—and then how they apply themselves.

The level you start at often determines how far you can go. Few street footballers make it to the top leagues in Europe. But those who start in proper football academies usually have a better shot. The same goes for the [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association). Getting scouted off the street is much harder than rising through an organized system. That’s why some parents are very intentional about where their kids apply their talents.

But even after applying yourself, you still need to get rewarded. As my dad always says, "_Knowledge or effort without reward is like a tree without fruit._"

And if you want to enjoy the fruits, you need to define what “reward” means to you. Is it fame? Respect? Genuine love from people? All of these, one way or another, tie back to money.

Let’s be real. You need money to live. And as a professional, you need money to keep doing what you do! If Olamide hadn’t earned from his early efforts in music, things could’ve turned out very differently for him. The biggest threat would’ve been _distraction_—the number one killer of dreams.

Distractions aren’t always external. Back then, Olamide or Wizkid would’ve needed money for studio sessions, beats, video shoots, and promotions. If they didn’t earn anything from music, they’d have had to do something else to raise the money—time that could’ve gone into improving their craft. And as they got older, responsibilities would only increase—siblings, parents, their own families.

Now, think about yourself.

You weren’t trained to write a new theorem or invent the next big thing. Even inventors are in it for the money! So, what _profitable_ skill are you offering the world that can translate into income? What are you giving people that makes them believe you’re worth paying?

When you imagine talented people, you probably assume they succeed from day one. But turning a raw skill into something people value is harder than solving a complex math problem or understanding physics laws. What makes people like [Olamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olamide), [Wizkid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizkid), and [Don Jazzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Jazzy) stand out is that they understand the concept of the [value chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain).

Even as an independent artist, you can’t succeed alone. You might create your beat and master your track, but that’s not enough. Your music needs to pass through the hands of marketers, promoters, and connectors who can bring it to the ears of big audiences. That’s the value chain. If your music is good, people will hear it—somewhere, somehow.

The same applies in every industry—sports, medicine, tech, you name it. No one works in isolation. Everyone plays a role in a massive machine. Some people are the engine. Others are the spark plugs, the belts, and the wires. Without each part, the system doesn’t run.

In football, imagine watching a match without commentary. Boring, right? So, commentators are part of the value chain. Even the companies that make the footballs—Nike, Puma—are part of it. Everyone contributes to making a 90-minute match something worth paying to watch.

Your skills will set you apart, but they won’t sustain you on their own. Many entrepreneurs think their product is enough to make them rich. It’s not. You still need the right people to connect the product to the right audience. Sometimes, you might have the audience but no product. It’s rare to have both.

That’s why the value chain is essential. It helps you determine where your skill fits best in the broader context. Imagine [Peter Drury](https://x.com/officialdrury) as a defender, or Wizkid as a backup drummer, or Eminem as a promoter. That would be a waste. Put people in the right place, and they become value creators. When money flows through the system, it flows through them.

When you're chasing the money in an industry, ask yourself, What's the total value of this industry? For example, in 2013, it was reported that [Lagosians spent over ₦36 billion on owambe annually](https://www.nairaland.com/1449873/lagosians-spend-n36bn-owambe-annually) —that’s entertainment alone! That’s an eye-opener. Next, ask: _What makes up this industry?_ And finally: _Where is your unique advantage?_

Tech is a huge space. Think about Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. If you're a guy from [Ajegunle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajegunle) with youth and brains, where can you apply yourself? Software engineering? Is that enough? Maybe. 😏

Advertising is another powerful industry. Companies pay big money to people with platforms to promote their products. Every year, there’s a massive budget set aside for ads. TV and radio stations get it. Billboard owners get it. And now, influencers get it. [Sabinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Funny) once said he could charge ₦1 million per post. [Kim Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian) charges $1 million!

In sports, you see it. Footballers have a transparent salary structure. You’re paying them to stay fit and play for 90 minutes. That fee also pays for Drury’s mortgage, the ball boy on the pitch, the stadium lights, and the doctors on standby.

And this applies to whatever you pay money for; your transport fare is not just paying the agbero, it pays for the fuel they buy as well. Your phone doesn’t just pay Apple; it pays the guys at the computer village bringing it closer to you. The snacks you eat doesn’t just make Dangote richer; they pay for the truck driver’s children’s school fees too!

Even scientists like [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) have YouTube channels. He talks science. You watch. YouTube pays him. Footballers play. You watch. They get paid. You write code. Someone uses the code, your company makes money, and your company pays you.

So here’s the truth:

**Once you become part of a system that solves a real problem, for an audience that’s big enough, you will get paid enough.**
