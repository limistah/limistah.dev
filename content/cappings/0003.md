title: What do you want moving forward?
date: 2023-11-22
summary: Over time, who we are is a reflection of what we have done. Who do we want to be? We do not need to change anything from what we do; we can choose the group that we want to belong to moving forward

I have a vivid memory of watching movies at neighboring homes with my friends. I would see a character and wish to be like that when I grow up. One that I can correctly recall is [Amitabh Bachchan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan). I remember his selflessness in his movies from the late 90s and early 2000s.

I also watched a few villains and decided never in my life would I want to be this kind of person growing up. I believe I made these decisions that have had a subconsciously profound impact on who I am today.

At this point in life, I am forging forward in my career, and my question remains: how can I be that person? Taking after their footsteps, attempt to replicate their achievements and earn similar accolades. I guess I want what other people want.

In November 2022, I decided that 2023 would solely focus on inner reflections. I am not sure if you would agree with me, but it is one of the key traits of high achievers. What reflection does is take you out of your reality, turning you into an observer of yourself.

More like having a big lamp over a piece of paper revealing all its printed content. Earlier this year, Bee (a good friend of mine) told me in one of our deep discussions, “It is good to take a step backward”.

My reflections gave me a lot of observations, but all led to a single trait: consistency. Most of what we are today are things that we have consistently done over a period of time. A student can become a graduate by consistently passing their exams. I am a software engineer because I consistently write lines of code every day.

I realized things I could have done more often over the past 3 years of my career that could amplify the results I have today. I am grateful; don’t mind me. How can I, as a human, not fulfill this verse of the [Qur’an 16:8](https://quran.com/en/an-nahl/18): 

> If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

I could have written more, spoken more at tech conferences, gotten enough tech certifications, and made more open-source contributions. I could have expanded my network far beyond what I have today.

All these are great realizations due to consistency, but I also realized that I could have been consistent only if I knew who I was. Recall that I had aspirations when I was younger to have some traits; trust me, I now possess those traits.

I do things people never expected other people to do for them (no brag), and I make decisions that take more people into consideration than average people would. I have other traits too, 😉.

Being consistent means having discipline; regardless, some things must happen. To be a disciplinarian does not entail you have to break too much; it entails you know what you are capable of and what can actually break you.

If your body doesn’t work late in the night, you really are doing a disservice to yourself by trying to force it through discipline to make it work at night.

If you realize that your body works well in the morning and needs to sleep during the night, discipline means that regardless of what is happening, you must write a paragraph every morning when you wake up. This means taking into consideration who you are and what you need to do.

For me, consistency means understanding my atmosphere, what prevents me from doing what I need to do, and what motivates it. I really would love to eliminate distractions, but as I have grown older and tried, I have realized I should work around distractions, not eliminate them.

A good way to work around distraction is to find when it is minimal. If you can control the velocity of the distraction, that would be a great advantage, as you can tell the distraction to go quiet when you need it, and afterward, it can continue to be what it wants to be.

Please agree with me that character emulation really doesn’t work as expected—for me at least. I realize that, as much as I have wanted to be like some certain figure, I am not like them; I am me (in Lil Wayne’s voice).

My life is unique (Victony: [My life is a different story](https://open.spotify.com/track/3qH7uGwlgr7tmoL4ksRhPi?autoplay=true)). My experience is unique, and my interactions with all the elements of life are unique. Moving forward, I want to remain myself, becoming a better version of myself every future second.

Generally, it has been a very useful experiment for me. and I am very glad that I attempted it. As we move on to the future, I hope to witness more consistency in things that will give me the results that I yearn for.

Going forward, I don’t want to be like anybody else; I want to be among the few, not among the many!
