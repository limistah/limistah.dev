Hi there,

One of the unique features of humans is the exceptional way we interact with each other. 

Sharing how we feel and what we are thinking helps others better align with us.

## I am writing on Substack

Yeah, I needed a place that holds my progress over time and somewhere I can share relevant information with people in the tech space. I remember that my journey started with having selftaughco.de, which is dead by now, to me.aleemisiaka.com, to aleemisiaka.com, and now limistah.dev

These transitions have followed a pattern of me sharing my thoughts about life and living, as well as my work.

This section is a way for me to reach a target audience (my friends, perhaps) and relate with them, since I keep a small circle of friends; others are welcome, too.

## What would you get?

Primarily, this section will discuss life itself, a publicly moderated and edited personal journal.

I am sure you are interested!

Yeahâ€¦

So, look out for my next posts on this section!

Cheers

Salut!
