Experiencing binary search was like a sincere revelation to the ingenuity of algorithms. How can a computer code be so clever and so efficient at the same time. We actually don't thank the inventors enough üòè.

Among the great, simple and almost in every day use algorithm is merge sort. It is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by taking a big problem, chunk it down into the smallest possible units, solve them up and add up the result together. Read more about it here.

While deeply studying merge sort, a question I further ask after seeing the patterns of its operations, is: does this under the hood was another binary seach algorithm? In this post, we will:
- Briefly talk about divide and conquer
- Introduce binary search
- Introduce merge sort
- Talk about their differences
- Finalize by helping you understand merge sort even better!
