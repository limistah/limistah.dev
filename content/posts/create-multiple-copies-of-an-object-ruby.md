excerpt: Duplicate an object in Ruby with dup, clone. Grasp the unique scenario in which each of the methods shines.
---

Since everything is an object in Ruby having a functionality that can duplicate objects is not a bad idea.

Ruby ships with two methods for making copies of an object: the `dup` method and the `clone` method.

> In Ruby, all variables hold a reference to an object. In a case where a section of a code modifies an object that is not meant to be modified, it is ideal to make a copy of that object to be used in that section of the code, protecting the integrity of the copied object.

> ```ruby
> # initial value of str
> str = "this is a test string"
> 
> # accepts a string
> def modifyAnyString (strVar) 
> 	# string is replaced with another string changing the value
> 	strVar.replace("this is a modified version of strVar")
> end
> 
> # call the modify string with the str variable
> modifyAnyString(str)
> 
> puts str # outputs: this is a modified version of strVar
> ```

> In some languages like C# and Java, this is called passing by value or dereferencing.





### The `dup` method

Take this `multiverse` object initialized below:

```ruby
multiverse = Object.new
```

We can pass `multiverse` to any method that has a write operation, this would affect the object.

```ruby
def getObjectID (obj)
  obj.object_id # returns the object ID of the passed object
end

puts getObjectID(multiverse) == multiverse.object_id # true
```

To avoid sending in the exact object by reference use the `Object.dup` method to create a copy of an object.

```ruby
puts getObjectID(multiverse.dup) == multiverse.object_id # false
```

Now, it is safer to pass the duplicated variable to a method. This would protect modifying `multiverse` objects in the `getObjectID` method if the method is not meant to do any write operation on the object.

> **Note**: If an object is frozen, the returned object will remain frozen, even after it has been duplicated.

```ruby
dup_multi = multiverse.dup
# freeze the dup_multi
dup_multi.freeze

frz_dup_multi = dup_multi.dup

# false original multiverse has not been frozen
puts multiverse.frozen? 

# true The dup_multi was frozen before duplication
puts frz_dup_multi.frozen? 
```



### The `copy` method

Copying an object is almost the same as _duplicating_ an object, the only difference is that, when copying, if the object is _frozen_, the copied object becomes _unfrozen_.

```ruby
copy_multi = multiverse.dup
# freeze the dup_multi
copy_multi.freeze

frz_copy_multi = copy_multi.dup

# false original multiverse has not been frozen
puts multiverse.frozen?

# false The copy_multi was frozen before duplication
puts frz_copy_multi.frozen? 
```

This can be useful to create a copy of the same object that is not restricted either by the function caller or by developers who want to ensure that a method consistently works with _unfrozen_ objects.
