I was solving a challenge and got to a point where I had to implement a store that could hold arbitrarily deeply nested objects. The new me, I need to see what others have done.

I found [dot-prop npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dot-prop), which solves it quite well.

But going through [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jasonrhodes/2321581), I found [this answer](https://gist.github.com/jasonrhodes/2321581?permalink_comment_id=1813156#gistcomment-1813156).

The author said a "functional way to solve it"...

And this right here, is an example of [declarative programming](/posts/imparative-declarative-coding/).

**I love this!**

Shalom...
