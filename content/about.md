I'm **Aleem Isiaka**, a backend and cloud engineer, solutions architect with a deep commitment to building resilient, scalable systems that drive measurable impact. With nearly a decade of experience across backend development, infrastructure, and distributed systems, I specialize in architecting solutions that merge reliability, performance, and automation with end user experience.

My work sits at the intersection of **site reliability engineering**, **cloud-native tooling**, and **developer experience**, with hands-on contributions spanning **Kubernetes**, **observability platforms**, and **infrastructure-as-code**. From architecting *high-throughput systems* to *reducing latency* and *improving uptime*, I thrive in environments where scale and fault-tolerance are not just nice-to-haves but core requirements.

I’ve led distributed teams, driven critical infrastructure overhauls, and delivered measurable impact, cutting response times by over 50%, increasing, and optimizing cloud operations across AWS, Azure, GCP, and Cloudflare ecosystems. I’m also an active contributor to the open-source community through initiatives like [**ObjectSpread**](https://objectspread.com) and [**WitOps**](https://witops.cloud), helping engineers build smarter operational practices.

Beyond code, I write extensively about **DevOps**, **backend engineering**, and **cloud migration strategies**, sharing lessons learned to support the next generation of engineers. I also [**track**](/reviews) reading journey across research papers, journals, and books, rooted in a belief that engineering is as much about curiosity as it is about execution.

I’m equally driven by a sense of purpose—whether it’s volunteering for open-source, exploring the beauty of system design, or asking the big questions about our universe. When I’m not building, I’m often journaling, learning history, or thinking deeply about how we can use engineering to solve problems in underserved communities.

If it must be done twice, I’ll automate it; if it must serve millions, I design it to scale.
