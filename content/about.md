I am a software engineer who enjoys solving complex problems with simple solutions by leveraging existing methods and technologies, and innovating when necessary. 

Technology helps me believe in the strong connection between focused human minds when tackling a problem. The world we have built is evidence of the statement.

I love mechanics; my aha moment was the application of boundary layer theory in our daily lives, fans, air conditioners, planes, ships, pots/kettles, and even the immediate atmosphere of the earth. I enjoy looking out into space. I still ask: What existed before the Big Bang? And since the universe is expanding, could the Big Bang be the effect of coming out of the other side of a black hole?

Building smart, distributed programs is my thing. Distributed tasks are the basis of nature and human civilization - and computing is not left out. I love speed, I love accuracy, I love tweaking existing systemsâ€”there should be a speed faster than the speed of light, I believe.

I like to listen to people's opinions on a topic. As a trained engineer, I accept that different individuals could arrive at unique solutions to the same problems even with the same constraints.

I believe that working hard means working smart. And working smart means becoming lazy. And to become lazy, automation should be in place. 

So, if I have to do it again, it should be automated.

I read books, journals, and research papers, follow them here: https://clio.limistah.dev
